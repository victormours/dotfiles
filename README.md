===

(Mac)Vim
===
- Space is the leader!
- `<Space>f` opens a file tree
- `<Space>d` opensa a fuzzy file finder
- `Ctrl` with `hjkl` moves from split to split
- `vv` opens a vertical split
- `ss` opens a horizontal one
- `Q` closes a split
- `<Space>g` opens a grep of the word under the cursor

Abbreviations!
-
- `pry!` for `require 'pry'; binding.pry`
- `spec!` for `require 'spec_helper'`

Git(Hub)
===
Super fast aliases (see `git/aliases`)

- `c my-branch` to checkout
- `l` to pull
- `gc "my commit message"` to add all and commit
- `p` to push
- `prm` to open a pull request towards the master branch
- `prs` to see all the pull requests in the current repo


Customizing
===
- If you want to add a machine-specific zsh config, you can do so by adding a zshrc file in the `local/` directory. `local/zshrc` will be loaded after `zsh/zshrc`.
